# Smart Contracts Demo

This directory contains demo smart contracts that utilize our Stellar Stock Price Oracle smart contract.

## Overview

This is a demonstration repository showing how to interact with and build on top of the SEP-compliant Oracle smart contract deployed on the Stellar network. The oracle contract itself provides:

- SEP-40 compliant oracle interface
- Price feed storage and retrieval
- Access control and authorization
- Event emissions for price updates

## Purpose

The demo contracts in this directory serve as examples of:
- How to read price data from the oracle
- How to build applications that depend on stock price feeds
- Integration patterns for Stellar smart contracts
- Best practices for oracle data consumption

## Status

🚧 Demo contracts will be added to showcase oracle usage patterns.
