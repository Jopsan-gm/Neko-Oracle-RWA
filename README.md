# 📌 Stellar Stock Price Oracle

An open-source **off-chain oracle system** that provides **real-world stock price data** to the **Stellar network** in a secure, modular, SEP-compliant way.

## 🎯 What this Project Does

This project fetches stock prices from multiple external financial APIs, normalizes and aggregates them, cryptographically signs the results, exposes them via a backend API, and supports on-chain submission to a Stellar oracle contract, so smart contracts can depend on real stock prices.

The goal is to make this **reliable, testable, and extensible**, with each part implemented as a separate app or package in this monorepo.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

The system consists of the following stages:

1. **Ingestor** - Connects to external stock price APIs
2. **Aggregator** - Normalizes, filters, and aggregates data
3. **Signer** - Produces signed proofs of aggregated prices
4. **API Publisher** - Exposes a REST/WebSocket endpoint
5. **Transactor** - Submits signed data on-chain
6. **Smart Contracts** - SEP-compliant Oracle on Stellar
7. **Frontend Demo** - UI for visualizing feeds

Data flows from raw external sources → ingestor → aggregator → signer → API → on-chain oracle.

## 📌 How We Work

Each app will be developed **one by one using issue prompts** that include:

- Context and goals
- Expected inputs and outputs
- Tech stack and conventions
- Acceptance criteria
- Minimal scaffolding (just enough to get started)

We will **not build everything at once** — each issue will introduce the next piece.

## 🧑‍💻 Contributions

Contributors should:

1. Read the contextual issue
2. Understand how their module fits into the architecture
3. Implement the minimum viable feature first
4. Add tests and documentation
5. Submit PRs with clear description
